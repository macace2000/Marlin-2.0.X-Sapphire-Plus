# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware

This is a fork of this repository, adapted to the Sapphire Plus
https://github.com/le3tspeak/Marlin-2.0.X-Sapphire-PRO

Which itself is a fork of the current bugfix version of Marlin >2.0.5.3

I don't actually own a Sapphire Plus, but compiled it for some people. Use it at your own risk.

* Connect heatsink fan to HE1 (connector for the second hotend) - automatically turns on/off at 50Â°C (optional)
* Classic Jerk disabled
* Junction Deviation (0.05)
* More menu items in the display menu (PID tuning, homing, ...)
* Filament sensor is disabled
* UART ready
* Neopixel ready
* probably forgot some things

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
